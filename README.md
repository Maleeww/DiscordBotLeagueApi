# DiscordBotLeagueApi
Discord Bot to interact with Riot Games' API for League of Legends

This was a small weekend project I worked in 2 years ago (2019-2020) and wanted to keep it archived.

Commited 12/02/2022, finished 29/01/2020 also included the updates instead of only the last version.

It should still function, but TOKEN (line 14 discordApiHandler.py) needs to be changed to a working token.

You'll have to create your own App on Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Use that app's token in the code, and grab your own invite URL since the one hardcoded is for my app.

You will also have to get your own Riot API Token for line 5 of 'leagueApiHandler.py'.

You can grab one on Riot Developer Portal (https://developer.riotgames.com/)
You'll need to update it every 24h if it's a personal use key.
